BVH Importer Script
===================
By [Jeroen Hoolmans](http://github.com/jhoolmans)

Introduction
------------
When working with motion capture data you may come across .bvh files. 
These files are [BioVision Hierarchy files](http://research.cs.wisc.edu/graphics/Courses/cs-838-1999/Jeff/BVH.html) 
that hold skeletal information and frame by frame animation.

This script is used to directly import the .bvh files and create a joint structure when needed. 
No need to load this file into MotionBuilder, or equivalent, and export it to a Maya supported format like FBX.

Installation
------------
Since this is a Python script you can run the script from a Python tab inside the script editor. 
But if you are frequently using this script I recommend installing the script in the Maya scripts folder.

Windows:

`C:\Users\<username>\Documents\maya\<version>\scripts\`

Mac OSX:

`/Users/Shared/Autodesk/maya/<version>/scripts/`

Linux:

`/home/<username>/maya/<version>/scripts/`

When the script is in place, launch or restart Maya. 
Go to your script editor, open a Python tab and run the following code:

	import bvh_importer
	bvh_importer.BVHImporterDialog()

Enjoy!
